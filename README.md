# javafx-angular-springboot-example
JavaFX, Angular and SpringBoot example app.

# Tools
This project uses Eclipse for the JavaFX/Spring-Boot pieces. Visual Studio Code for the Angular piece. The root of the Angular app is in src/main/resources/JASJApp. You will need to run "npm install" there to get things going. Run "ng build" there before launching the JavaFX piece in Eclipse.

# Eclipse
I use Maven for dependency management. Run the JavaFX piece by right clicking onf JasjApplication.java and "Run as a Java Application".
